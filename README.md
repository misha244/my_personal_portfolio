## About my Project

This is my personal portfolio. I've created it as a homework during week 2 of my Coding Bootcamp, but will be updating it as I complete more projects and further develop my skills. Ultimately this portfolio will hopefully serve as a stepping stone in my future career in tech. I've utilised the **_HTML/CSS_** skills I've gained so far and gained a few more, while working on it. I have incorporated **media queries**, **flex container** and **CSS variables** to create a responsive and functional portfolio.
