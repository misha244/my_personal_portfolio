          As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To
          me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United
          States. Even before I first wandered into the cabstand for an
          after-school job, I knew I wanted to be a part of them. It was there
          that I knew that I belonged. To me, it meant being somebody in a
          neighborhood that was full of nobodies. They weren't like anybody
          else. I mean, they did whatever they wanted. They double-parked in
          front of a hydrant and nobody ever gave them a ticket. In the summer
          when they played cards all night, nobody ever called the cops.
