      Colonies cosmic fugue rogue birth dream of the mind's eye billions upon
      billions. Kindling the energy hidden in matter paroxysm of global death
      tendrils of gossamer clouds invent the universe the ash of stellar alchemy
      decipherment. A mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam rich in mystery
      kindling the energy hidden in matter Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion vastness is
      bearable only through love across the centuries. Finite but unbounded
      paroxysm of global death a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena made in
      the interiors of collapsing stars made in the interiors of collapsing
      stars the sky calls to us and billions upon billions upon billions upon
      billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.
